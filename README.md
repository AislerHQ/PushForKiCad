# AISLER Push for KiCad
### Push your layout to AISLER with just one click for instant Powerful Prototyping

Want to use Powerful Prototyping or Amazing Assembly from AISLER? This plugin will provide you with a convenient one-click push to our service.


When you click the AISLER Push-Button we will export your project's

- Gerber Files in the right format, so that production will run ultra-smooth
- IPC-Netlist-File to enable Smart Tests for production so that you get feedback down to the tiniest trace on how to improve your design for production
- BOM-file to import all components you have already assigned in your project 
- P'n'P-file to get your project ready for assembly

Once the upload (which will only take a couple of seconds) is complete you can place your order within less than one minute. If you iterate on your design and click the push button again, we will make sure your project is only stored as a new revision on our server.
